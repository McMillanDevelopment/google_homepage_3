This is my third attempt at making the google homepage.

1. First attempt was fighting with flexbox.
2. Second attempt was learning the basics of flexbox but not getting things quite right.
3. For this attempt I will be using CSS Grid for the overall layout. Each individual grid item will then use flexbox for align / justify purposes. I tested out these techniques intially in codepen.io and followed w3 schools examples.
